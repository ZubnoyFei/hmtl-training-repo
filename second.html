        <dd>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, allows web users to create and structure sections, paragraphs, and links
            using elements, tags, and attributes. However, it’s worth noting that HTML is not considered a programming
            language as it can’t create dynamic functionality.

            CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
            CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
            CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
            External stylesheets are stored in CSS files

            JavaScript often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core
            technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.[11] Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the
            client side for web page behavior,[12] often incorporating third-party libraries.[13] All major web browsers
            have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.

            JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript
            standard.[14]
            It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm,
            supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming
            interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the
            Document
            Object Model (DOM).

            <td>JPEGs offer you the most flexibility with raster editing and compression making them ideal for web
                images
                that need to be downloaded quickly.
            </td>
            <td>PNGs are often used if size is not an issue and the image is complex, because a PNG file holds more
                information than a JPG.
            </td>
            <td>SVG is vector and declarative
                If you know you need vector art, SVG is the choice. Vector art is visually crisp and tends to be a
                smaller
                file size than raster graphics like JPG. If you care a lot about the flexibility and responsiveness of
                the
                graphic, SVG is the way.
            </td>
            <td>You should use a GIF when…

                You want to create web animation. GIF images hold all of the animation frames and timing information in
                one
                single file. ...
                You need transparency. GIF images have an “alpha channel” that can be transparent, so you can place your
                image on any colored background.
                You need a small file.

                WebP is a modern image format that provides superior lossless and lossy compression for images on the
                web.
                Using WebP, webmasters and web developers can create smaller, richer images that make the web faster.

                image
                during download. ...
                Delivers both lossless (bit-preserving) and lossy compression within a code stream. ...

            <td>he JPEG format has been in use for a long time and is extremely portable;
                The JPEG format is compatible with almost every image processing application;
                The JPEG format is compatible with most of the hardware devices e.g printers etc – therefore it is very
                easy
                to print the images in JPEG format;
            </td>
            <td> minimum compression loss. The image quality is not changed by any compression ratio;
                – format is suitable for storage of intermediate versions of the image. When you re-save image, quality
                is
                not lost;
                – PNG supports a large number of colors. PNG-8 (256 colors) and PNG-24 (about 16.7 million. Colors);
            </td>
            <td>Unlike standard images, SVG images are vector and do not lose quality when resized or zoomed in the
                browser.
                This makes them accessible for many devices and browsers. Raster formats like PNG and JPG become
                pixilated
                when resized.
                SVG graphics are resolution-independent. Other image formats may require extra assets/data to fix
                resolution-based issues, depending on the device.
            </td>
            <td>One of the main advantages of using animated gifs is the size which can be relatively smaller compared
                with
                other file formats. Moreover, this can be advantageous when loading images online as they can load
                quicker
                without losing its quality.
            </td>
            <td>Faster loading times; Less media storage; Transparency and animation</td>
            <td>The capability of showing bilevel, gray-scale, palette-color, and full-color data in several color
                spaces.
                No limit for the amount of private or special-purpose information in the metadata.

            <td>Недостатки</td>
            <td>JPEG compression technique is a lossy compression. Lossy compression means that after the image is
                compressed in JPEG format, it loses certain actual contents of the image;
                Quality of Image is reduced after JPEG compression owing to the loss of actual content of the image.
                JPEG image compression is not suitable for images with sharp edges and lines. JPEG image format is not
                capable of handling animated graphic images;
                JPEG images do not support layered images. The graphic designer needs to work on layered images in order
                to
                manipulate and edit graphic images which are not possible with JPEG Images;
            </td>
            <td>
                – doesn’t support animation;
                – ill-suited for working with full-color images;
                – can not store multiple images in one file;
            </td>
            <td>The SVG format is great for 2D graphics like logos and icons but is not ideal for detailed pictures.
                SVG-based graphics can’t display as many details as standard image formats since they are rendered using
                points and paths instead of pixels
            </td>
            <td>The fact that it only uses a color palette of 256 colors, the animated images created can sometimes look
                poorer in comparison to other image files. For some instances, images can look slightly pixelated or
                images
                that can look blocky.
            </td>
            <td>Not supported by all browsers; Quality is still reduced</td>
            <td>JPEG 2000 works in only certain browsers.
                JPEG 2000 is not backward compatible. To also leverage the original JPEG format, developers and other
                digital professionals who adopt JPEG 2000 must code in a new standard.
                Encoding JPEG 2000 files, which involves modifying the CPU and adding code, is resource intensive,
                requiring
                much more memory for processing. Given the high capacity of modern machines, that issue likely no longer
                exists. However, when JPEG 2000 first debuted in 2000, its memory requirement posed a significant
                concern.
